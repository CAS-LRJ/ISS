# ISS
This repo provides ROS-noetic support for the ISS project, compatible with CARLA 0.9.13. The development of this repository is ongoing.

**Note**: This repository utilizes **ROS's right-handed** coordinate system. This is distinct from **CARLA's left-handed** coordinate system. The ``carla_bridge`` node is responsible for handling the necessary conversions between these two coordinate systems.
